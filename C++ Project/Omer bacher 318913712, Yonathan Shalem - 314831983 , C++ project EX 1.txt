1. Project Overview

This project implements a cooperative two-player text adventure game played in the console.
Both players are controlled by the user and must work together in order to progress through
multiple rooms and reach the final screen.

The game includes interactive elements such as doors, switches, obstacles and riddles.
Progression is based on cooperation, correct actions, and solving challenges designed into
each room.


2. How to Solve the Game

The game is solved by progressing through the rooms in the correct order while using
cooperation between the two players.

Doors and Progression:
- All doors require a key in order to be opened.
- Each door leads to the next screen in the game.
- A door can only be used after all required conditions in the room are met.

Switches and Temporary Walls:
- Switches must be activated by stepping on them.
- All switches in the room must be ON in order to allow door opening.
- Temporary walls (marked as 's') block paths and are removed only after all switches are ON.

Obstacles:
- Obstacles ('*') block movement.
- An obstacle can be pushed only when both players move in the same direction and toward
  the obstacle.
- Cooperation between both players is required to clear paths.

Riddles:
- Riddles are marked with '?'.
- When stepping on a riddle, the player may choose whether to solve it or not.
- Correct answer:
  - Removes the riddle from the map.
  - Grants 100 points.
- Wrong answer:
  - Causes the player to lose a life.
- Riddles include optional hints that can be requested during gameplay.
- If a player loses all lives, a message is displayed and the game handles this state safely.


3. Bonus Features Implemented

We request bonus points for the following features:

- Color-enhanced gameplay:
  The game uses colors to improve visual clarity and user feedback, including player status,
  interactive elements and on-screen messages.

- Animated text boxes and visual feedback:
  The game uses animated text boxes for riddles, messages and feedback.
  Animations are integrated smoothly into the game flow and enhance the user experience.

- Riddle hints system:
  Each riddle includes optional hints that can be requested by the player during interaction,
  improving usability without revealing the solution.

- Switch-based room logic with temporary walls:
  Rooms include switch-controlled temporary walls ('s') that are dynamically removed only
  after all switches are activated, creating more complex and interactive puzzles.


Additional Notes:
- The game logic avoids recursive menu/game calls.
- External or AI-assisted code is documented in comments where required.
- All design decisions follow the exercise requirements.
